                  Florida Statutes (718.112 and 719.106) require condominium and
                  cooperative buildings that are three stories or taller to have
                  and maintain a study of reserve funds. This is necessary for
                  any future major repairs and replacements of their common
                  elements. Our team is equipped to perform these studies prior
                  to the turnover of properties to unit owners.
